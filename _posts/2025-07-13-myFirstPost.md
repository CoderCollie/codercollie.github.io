title: I've Decided to Restart My Blog
---

Hi! I'm coder.collie. You may not know me, but I recently decided to start a new, anonymous blog.

About six years ago, in 2018, I started my first blog. Over time, it grew to over 2,000 daily visitors. Of course, those numbers have dropped since the rise of ChatGPT and other AI tools. Still, looking back, that blog became an important milestone in my personal history.

Lately, work has kept me busy, and it's been hard to post even once a month. Writing started to feel boring and uninspiring. I think the main reason is that my old blog no longer felt fresh, so I decided to create a new one and make a fresh start.

As you and I both know, in the era of ChatGPT, traditional blogging can feel outdated. People don't always turn to search engines anymore—they just ask an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude. Even I, as a blogger, often find answers from LLMs. Sometimes I wonder if maintaining a blog is still a good strategy. But honestly, I'm not sure. What I do know is that writing helps me learn and create my own content. Maybe there’s nothing truly new that LLMs can’t mimic, but writing about what I’ve learned helps me grow. So, even if it’s just for myself, blogging is valuable.

## Goal or Objective of This Blog

The main goal of this blog is to write about everything I learn while developing or studying. It’s not just a dev log—it’s more like a scratchpad or notepad for archiving what I’ve learned each day. Ironically, keeping this kind of archive helps me improve at work. One thing I always prioritize is consistency. Being steady always leads to improvement.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful here—or at least enjoy following along on my journey!
