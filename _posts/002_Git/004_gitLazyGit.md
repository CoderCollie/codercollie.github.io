install lazy git.
I used to use git via only termianl. I'm a big fan of vim and terminal because GUI environment makes me slower and less productive, I don't want to mouse equipment or scroll wheel. Anyway, I also want to use git via terminal, but actually native git in terminal is not good for checking diffrences and squash. In my case, I used to make commites frequenlty when there is a bit small difference. I know that is not a bad habit, but I actually did. After already making lots of tiny commits, I should squash those commit to clean the git commit history. In GUI environment like intellij, it is easy to check the entire differences along the whole commit, but, in terminal, it is not that easy.

Therefore I decided to find a better way to manage these commits then I found the LazyGit


brew install lazygit
